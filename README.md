## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a complete pipeline for **4D fetal cardiac reconstruction** from echocardiography. Our pipeline introduces:

- **FeEcho4D**: The first benchmark dataset for radial fetal echocardiography.
- **SCOPE-Net**: A novel geometry-aware segmentation network.
- **Graph-Fourier Mesh Reconstruction**: High-fidelity reconstruction from sparse radial slices.
- **Clinical Evaluation**: Ejection Fraction (EF), Global Longitudinal/Circumferential Strain (GLS/GCS).

## 🧭 Pipeline Overview
We propose a three-stage framework for 4D fetal LV analysis:
-	**(A)**	Radial Data Preparation: Extract 2D slices by rotating planes around the LV center.
-	**(B)**	SCOPE-Net Segmentation: Perform prompt-guided, symmetry-aware segmentation on radial slices.
-	**(C)**	Graph-Fourier Reconstruction: Reconstruct temporally consistent 3D LV meshes using GHD + DVS, enabling clinical metric estimation.

## 🧠 SCOPE-Net: Symmetry-Aware Prompt-Guided Segmentation

**SCOPE-Net is designed specifically for radial fetal ultrasound. It integrates:**
-	Flip-Consistent Radial Attention (FCRA) for angular symmetry modeling.
-	Inter-Slice Augmentation Invariance (ISAI) for self-supervised consistency.
-	Prompt Conditioning using bounding box or scribble inputs.
-	Efficient 2.5D training with 56G FLOPs per frame (vs. 79G for 3D UNet).

**Architecture Highlights:**
-	U-Net backbone with symmetry-aware modules.
-	Optional spatial prompts injected via gating.
-	Robust to radial view variations and signal dropout.

</p>

**🔍 Experiment:** We compare point clouds between predicted and ground-truth meshes in both short-axis views and 3D perspectives on FeEcho4D and MITEA, using SCOPE-Net vs. UNet.
**✅ Summary:** SCOPE-Net shows superior spatial alignment, especially at the apex and lateral wall, indicating better segmentation consistency and reconstruction quality.

**🔍 Experiment:** On the MITEA dataset, we evaluate clinical metrics (EF, GLS) predicted by SCOPE-Net+GHD, UNet+GHD, and 3D UNet, reporting Pearson r, MSE, and 95% confidence intervals.
**✅ Summary:** Our method achieves the highest accuracy and lowest variance, demonstrating strong potential for reliable clinical use in fetal cardiac analysis.
